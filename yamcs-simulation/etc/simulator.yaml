# PERFORMANCE TESTING
#if perfTestNumPackets > 0, 
# then the simulator it will send that number of packets of perfTestPacketSize with the delay in between each packet of perfTestPacketInterval ms
#
# the packets will contain random data
# use the org.yamcs.simulator.PerfDataDbLoader to generate a corresponding XTCE database to be able to monitor the perftest packets
