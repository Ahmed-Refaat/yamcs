Post-installation Setup
=======================

After you have installed Yamcs, you are ready to initialize a Yamcs configuration. This includes:

* Setting up a data directory
* Setting up a configuration directory

Depending on your chosen installation method, it may be that you can skip this section. In particular, rpm distributions apply conventions by using a pre-defined data directory and set of configuration files.
