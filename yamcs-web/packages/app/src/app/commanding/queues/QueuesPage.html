    Queues
    <app-help>
      <p>
        A queue is a temporary holding location for issued commands that are waiting to enter the next stage of
        processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Queues are an ordered list. Issued commands are offered to the first matching queue.
      </p>
      <p>
        A queue can perform these actions:
      </p>
      <table class="ya-data-table">
        <tr>
          <td width="1">
            ACCEPT
          </td>
          <td>The queue accepts and releases commands.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <span class="blink">HOLD</span>
          </td>
          <td>The queue accepts commands but does not release them. These commands may be
            released manually, or automatically as soon as the queue action changes to ACCEPT.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            REJECT
          </td>
          <td>The queue does not accept commands. Any attempt to issue a command matched to a
            disabled queue will fail immediately.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
